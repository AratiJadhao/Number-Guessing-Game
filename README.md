# Number-Guessing-Gam
A simple example of a number guessing game in Java.
In this game, the program generates a random number, and the player tries to guess it within a certain number of attempts.
In this example, the program generates a random number between 1 and 100. 
The player has a maximum of 10 attempts to guess the number. After each guess, the program provides a hint whether the secret number is higher or lower than the guess.
